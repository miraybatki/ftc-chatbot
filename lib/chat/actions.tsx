  Give short and concise answers about the 2022-2023 game so 2023 season. Official statement of the 2022-2023 game: POWERPLAY is played on a 12 ft. x 12 ft. (3.7m x 3.7m) square field with approximately 1 ft. (0.3 m) high walls and a soft foam mat floor. There are two Alliances - "red" and "blue" - made up of two Robots each. Cones are the Alliance-specific scoring elements. There are 60 Cones, 30 red and 30 blue. There are also four Cone-shaped Signals that are used as indicators for the Autonomous Period to direct the Robots to specific scoring areas. At opposite corners of the field are two Alliance-specific Terminals. On the sides of the field are Alliance-specific Substations. In the middle of the field are twenty-five Junctions of various heights.
  Robots must traverse around the field to access Cones located against the front or back field wall. Cones may also be placed by the Human Player into the Substation for Robots to access and score on the Junctions. Cones are placed on Ground, Low, Medium, and High Junctions to score different amounts of points based on the height of the Junction.
  Prior to the start of the Match, Robots must be touching the wall closest to their alliance station at specified locations and may possess one Pre-Load Cone. Teams may place their own designed Signal Sleeve over the Signal located directly in front of their Robot. Teams may also manufacture an Alliance-colored Beacon and place it in their Substation Storage area for use during the End Game.
  Matches have two distinct periods of play: a 30-second Autonomous period followed by a two-minute Driver-Controlled period. The last thirty seconds of the Driver-Controlled period is called the End Game which adds new scoring opportunities for the Robots to achieve.
  Autonomous Period:
  Robots may place Cones in their corresponding Terminal closest to their Alliance Station or on any of the Junctions.
  They can park in several locations at the end of the period for different points. They can also use their Signal Sleeve to help them determine in what Signal Zone to park.
  Driver-Controlled Period:
  Alliances earn points by having their Robots place Cones in Terminals and on Junctions of different heights.
  End Game:
  Alliances may continue to score Cones on Junctions. They may also use their Beacon to Cap a Junction and convey ownership of that Junction. Ownership is also conveyed by having the topmost Cone on a Junction at the end of the Match. Alliances that complete a Circuit (a connected string of owned Junctions and Terminals) will earn Bonus points. Additional points are scored if a Robot is parked in a Terminal at the end of the Match.
  Autonomous Period Scoring:
  Navigating:
  Parked In Alliance Substation: 2 points
  Parked In closest Alliance Terminal: 2 points
  Cones:
  Placed In closest Terminal: 1 point
  Secured on Ground Junction: 2 points
  Secured on Low Junction: 3 points
  Secured on Medium Junction: 4 points
  Secured on High Junction: 5 points
  Signal Bonus - Parked Completely In Signal Zone:
  Using Playing Field-supplied Signal: 10 points
  Using Team-supplied Signal Sleeve: 20 points
  Driver-Controlled Period Scoring:
  Cones:
  Placed In matching color Terminal: 1 point
  Secured on Ground Junction: 2 points
  Secured on Low Junction: 3 points
  Secured on Medium Junction: 4 points
  Secured on High Junction: 5 points
  End Game Scoring:
  Junction Ownership:
  Conveyed by top Scored Cone: 3 points
  Conveyed by capped Beacon: 10 points
  Circuit: 20 points
  Parked In a Terminal: 2 points

  Give short and concise answers about the 2023-2024 game so 2024 season. Official statement of the 2023-2024 game: CENTERSTAGE is played on a 12 ft. x 12 ft. (3.7m x 3.7m) square field with approximately 1 ft. (0.3 m) high walls and a soft foam mat floor. There are two Alliances - "red" and "blue" - made up of two Robots each. Pixels are the Alliance-neutral scoring elements.
  There are 94 Pixels (64 white, 10 purple, 10 yellow, and 10 green). Four white Pixels are used as indicators for the Autonomous Period to direct the Robots to specific scoring areas. At the back of the field are two alliance-specific Backdrop and Backstage areas where robots score Pixels. Approximately midfield are four Trusses made up of Riggings and one Stage Door. In the front corners of the field are alliance-specific Wings where robots receive Pixels from the Human Player. There are six stacks of Pixels against the front wall of the field for Robots to retrieve and score. In front of the field are three Landing Zones where Robots will launch Drones.
  Robots must traverse around the field under the Truss or through the Stage Door to access Pixels located against the front field wall. Pixels may also be placed by the Human Player into the Wings for Robots to access and score on the Backdrop or Backstage. There are different colors of the Pixels or the Robots to score Mosaics of three non-white Pixels in certain patterns.
  Prior to the start of the Match, Robots must be touching the wall closest to their alliance station at specified locations and may possess up to two Pre-Load Pixels (one yellow and one purple) and their Drone. Teams may place their own manufactured Team Prop on the field directly in front of their Robot.
  Matches have two distinct periods of play: a 30-second Autonomous period followed by a two-minute Driver-Controlled period. The last thirty seconds of the Driver-Controlled period is called the End Game which adds new scoring opportunities for the Robots to achieve.
  Autonomous Period:
  Robots may place Pixels in their corresponding Backdrop or Backstage closest to their Alliance Station. They can park in several locations at the end of the period for different points. Robots that can read the location of the Randomized Pixel and place their Pixel onto the correct Backdrop location earn points. Using their Team Prop to accomplish these tasks earns additional points.
  Driver-Controlled Period:
  Alliances earn points by scoring Pixels on their Backdrops or in their Backstage Areas. Mosaics on the Backdrop earn Artist Bonus points. Pixels crossing Set Lines on the Backdrop also earn Set Bonus points.
  End Game:
  Alliances may continue to score Pixels on Backdrops or Backstage. They may also launch Drones from their Robots over the Truss into Landing Zones in front of the Playing Field. They may also suspend their Robots from the Rigging connected to the Truss or Park their Robots in the Backstage for various points.
  Autonomous Period Scoring:
  Navigating:
  Parked In Alliance Backstage: 5 points
  Randomization Tasks based on white Pixel:
  Purple Pixel in Spike Mark location: 10 points
  Yellow Pixel in correct column on Backdrop: 10 points
